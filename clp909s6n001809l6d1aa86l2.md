Full-stack software development is the practice of working on both the front-end and back-end aspects of a software application.

A "full-stack" developer is proficient in handling all layers of an application, from the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) on the front end to the server-side logic and database interactions on the back end. Basically, handling everything from the beginning.

This is a quick guide on a full-stack software developer roadmap. Hopefully, it will be a help to you! This roadmap assumes no prior knowledge and progresses step-by-step through various technologies, languages, and concepts.
